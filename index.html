                Mother: "What bedtime story do you want to hear tonight sweetie."<br>
                Child: "My favorite one! About the legend in the sky!"<br>
                Mother: "Okay, but only if you brushed your teeth like you were supposed to."<br>
                Child: "Mooooom! I did!"<br>
                Mother: "Now where do I start..."<br>
                Child: "On the third year of the great war..."<br>
                Mother: "Oh yes, thats how your dad usually starts it, isn't that right? Well, on the third year of the greatest war, a brave squadron flew behind enemy lines to gather intelligence. The journey
                inward was easy, suspiciously easy. However, any gut feelings of suspicion were quickly dismissed to ensure a
                successful stealth mission. When the information was gathered and our brave men and women began to fly back, they were
                ambushed. During the hardfought battle in the sky, our planes were hit again and again. One by one they plummeted in
                brilliant explosions of red, orange, and black against the cold, blue, and white sky. One after another they fell, until
                there was but one left. And what happened after that is the stuff of myths and legends..."<br>
