# Legend of the Sky


## Background

Legend of the Sky starts off as a bedtime story a mother is telling her child. It is a story the child loves to hear again and again. On the third year of the greatest war, a brave squadron flew behind enemy lines to gather intelligence. The journey inward was easy, a little too easy. However, any gut feelings of suspicion were quickly dismissed in favor of ensuring a successful stealth mission. When the information was gathered and our brave men and women began to fly back, they were ambushed. During the hardfought battle in the sky, our planes were hit again and again. One by one they plummeted in brilliant explosions of red, orange, and black against the cold, blue, and white sky. One after another they fell, until there was but one left. And what happened after that is the stuff of myths and legends.

## Overview

The player assumes control of the hero pilot and their aircraft. Outnumbered 50 to 1 and trapped behind enemy lines they have no choice but to fight. The player sees a top down view of their plane, and controls the angle of turn on the plane while the plane perpetually moves forward. The player's objective is to fly around the map and shoot down all enemy aircraft so they can escape the enemy airspace with the intel. Enemy planes fly around the map and when they spot the enemy they fire. There are bundles of plane armor floating in the sky from the fallen squadron mates. Shot down enemies will also drop this armor. Flying into the bundles gives the pilot addition armor so that they can tke more hits. There are also fuel bundles the player must grab in order to stay in the air, also dropped by downed enemies. The viewport of the canvas is set to a specified size, but the sky map is a lot larger than the view port. Exiting the corners of the map makes you reenter on the opposite side. 

## Functionality and MVPs
